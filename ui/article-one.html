                I have also enrolled myself for the certification exam being coonducted by IIT Madras.
                Such certification is very valuable for students who cannot directly qualify to study in these insititutions
                as they have very limited seats and ofcoure you have to be outstanding student to get admitted.

                or inderctly involved in making this course live.
