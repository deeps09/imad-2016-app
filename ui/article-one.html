	                This is my first article on IMAD course.
	                I got to know about this course from newspaper and was very exited about its commencement.
	                So far I am able to understand each and every thing clearly and will try follow along all the stuffs that I have learned
	                from this forum.

	                I have also enrolled myself for the certification exam being coonducted by IIT Madras.
	                Such certification is very valuable for students who cannot directly qualify to study in these insititutions
	                as they have very limited seats and ofcoure you have to be outstanding student to get admitted.

	                I am very keen to learn Android devlopment as I have some prior experience in C#.net and Object Oriented Programming 
	                Language, so I am very pleased to attend this session and want to thanks the faculty members and everyone who is directly
	                or inderctly involved in making this course live.
