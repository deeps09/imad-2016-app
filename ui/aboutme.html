            <p>
            Hi.. First of all thanks for visiting my web page, it is my little effort to showcase what I have learnt so far from IMAD course conducted by
            NPTEL. I have been learning Android development from Udacity.com from last six months and wanted to understand what goes behind the server side.
            The whole purpose of taking this course was to get an idea for making my own API which can be consumed by Android app.</p>

            <p>Well, academically I have completed MCA and always wanted to be a developer, initially I was inclined towards .Net development, also I have done development for 6-8 months but sometime destiny is not what you want from it. Later, due to some personal reasons I had to start in healthcare industry and continued working in same industry and now I am having experience of 6 years in Healthecare IT but now I realize my passion and wanted to switch back to development hence I am trying my best to understand best practices and most used platforms to start with.</p>

            <p>Thanks again for going through my profile.</p><br/><br/><br/>
